# Parrot Requirements Kata

Small requirements finding exercise inspired by the [Parrot Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Parrot-Refactoring-Kata).

See `ParrotRequirements.txt` for the requirements of the little program found in the source folder. 
Please write executable specifications in the platform specific unit testing framework without looking at the production code.
When all test cases are done, run a coverage test to verify that all production code is tested.
